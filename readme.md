This is not fully automated you have to do little scraping manually. I made it so that I can downlod bunch of party songs for my friend's wedding. Hopefully someday in future I'll consider working on this thing again.  

- Please install ffmpeg software and add it to the path on your system. This is very important, I wasted 3 hours behind this.

- The usual git clone, npm install. 

- Use the commented code on index.js page to scrape youtube music.

- Copy the scrapped data into list.js

- Hit node index.js

- Songs will be downloaded to the output folder.
